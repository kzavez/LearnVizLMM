Description: Summarizes characteristics of linear mixed effects models without 
    data or a fitted model by converting code for fitting lmer() from 'lme4' 
    and lme() from 'nlme' into tables, equations, and visuals. Outputs can be 
    used to learn how to fit linear mixed effects models in 'R' and to 
    communicate about these models in presentations, manuscripts, and analysis 
    plans.
