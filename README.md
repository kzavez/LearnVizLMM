The objective of this package is to summarize characteristics of linear
mixed effects models (LMMs) without data or a fitted model. Its
functions convert code for fitting `nlme::lme()` and `lme4::lmer()`
models into tables, equations, and visuals. These outputs can be used
for learning how to fit LMMs in R and communicating about LMMs in
presentations, manuscripts, and analysis plans.
